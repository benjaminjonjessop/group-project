# Renewable Energy and Carbon Emissions: A Cross-Country Analysis (2000–2023)

> Analyzing whether countries with a higher share of renewable energy in their total energy supply emit less CO₂ per capita.

---

## Project Overview

Global CO₂ emissions continue to rise despite record investments in renewable energy. This project investigates whether a **higher share of renewable energy in total energy supply** is associated with **lower per-capita carbon emissions**.  

The analysis uses international, country-level data (2000–2023) to examine how renewable electricity share relates to total and per-capita CO₂ emissions. By quantifying this relationship, the project aims to shed light on the **real-world effectiveness of renewable energy transitions** in reducing emissions and to identify regional variations in outcomes.  

- **Objective:** Determine whether increasing the renewable share of national energy supply corresponds with lower CO₂ emissions per capita.  
- **Domain:** Sustainability / Environmental Data Science / Energy Economics  
- **Key Techniques:** Panel regression, correlation analysis, clustering, changepoint analysis, visualization

## Data

- **Primary Sources:**
  1. [Global Carbon Atlas](https://globalcarbonatlas.org) — CO₂ emissions by country (total, per capita, and per GDP).  
  2. [International Energy Agency (IEA) Global Energy Review 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025) — Global CO₂ and energy statistics.  
  3. [World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators) — Renewable electricity share, GDP, and population.  
  4. [Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy 2025](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) — Energy demand and supply by fuel and region.  
  5. [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 100% Clean Electricity Study](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/100-percent-clean-electricity-by-2035-study.html) — Scenario analysis of decarbonization pathways.

- **Data Format:** CSV files (annual, country-level observations).  
- **Data Preparation:** Merging datasets by country and year, converting units to metric tons per capita, handling missing values, and normalizing scales.  
- **Estimated Size:** ≤10,000 rows (≈200 countries × 40 years).

## Analysis

We conduct a **quantitative, correlational analysis** using a **country-year panel dataset**.  

**Steps include:**
1. **Descriptive analysis:** Summary statistics, scatterplots, and time-series trends.  
2. **Correlation analysis:** Identify relationships between renewable share and emissions metrics.  
3. **Panel regression:** Estimate associations while controlling for GDP and year effects.  
4. **Optional extensions:**  
   - **Clustering** countries by energy mix and emissions trajectory.  
   - **Changepoint detection** to identify inflection points following renewable adoption.  

**Reproduction order:**
1. `data_preprocessing.ipynb` — Import and clean datasets.  
2. `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` — Generate descriptive and correlation visualizations.  
3. `regression_model.ipynb` — Run panel regressions and infer relationships.  
4. `results_summary.ipynb` — Summarize findings and export visualizations.

## Results

Preliminary expectations are that:
- Countries with **higher renewable energy shares** will tend to exhibit **lower per-capita CO₂ emissions**, though the strength and consistency of the relationship may vary by region and economic structure.  
- There may be **time delays** between renewable adoption and measurable reductions in emissions.  
- **GDP and energy demand** are expected to moderate the observed associations.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Challenges

1. **Causality:** Establishing causal interpretation beyond correlation.  
2. **Data completeness:** Missing or inconsistent data for developing countries.  
3. **Interpretation:** Ensuring visualizations and results are contextualized and responsibly communicated.  

Sensitivity checks and transparent discussion of assumptions will be incorporated throughout.
